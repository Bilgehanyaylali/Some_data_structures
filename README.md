![Some Data Structures](https://github.com/Bilgehanyaylali/Some_data_structuress/assets/151865735/e0e68bbf-a25d-4edc-bf9c-19e4b8de5601)
I made a lot of my own examples as well as tried to replicate the significant structures I saw throughout the course in this repository.
For easier comprehension, I have broken down the List, Dictionary, Tuple, and Set structures individually.
I tried not to explain the subject, but to concentrate on the application of methods.
Well worth reading.
